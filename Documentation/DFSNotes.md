#NOTES:

- Don't make a checkpoint tool, instead just use the 3D software and determine what positions a checkpoint needs to be placed at
- What the fuck does audio for race cars involve
- Can you get some tire particles? Skid marks when drifting for example but all physics based?

#To Do:

- Game menu
	- Main menu screen with something animating?
	- Maybe add a camera that just keeps moving around the car or something?

	- Buttons:
		- Start Race
		- View best run
		- Settings (Only going to be audio probably. Maybe not worth adding this even)
		- Exit

	- Start Race:
		- Select Track

- Race HUD
	-	Add a race HUD
	-	Display a speedometer
	- 	Display lap counter
	- 	Display timer on screen


- Split screen multiplayer
	- Can you create more than one player controllers? (YES)
	- Can you create more than 1 waypoint systems? (YES)
	- Is the UI getting data through the player controller (Probably will)

#Juice WRLD

- Add a fucking sky box for fuck sakes
- Maybe not have the track being fucking white bro
- Add some more 3Dness to the scene with some placeholder stuff
- Adding trees may be good? especially in sections around the track
