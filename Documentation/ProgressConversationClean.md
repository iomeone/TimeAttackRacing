# DFS 2 Progress Conversation 

Date: 03-April-2020

Current Plan:

## WEEK 11: CAR TUNING AND ASYNC RESOURCE LOAD (Next Week)

### Plan Proposed:

-	[3] Implement Car Tuning Tool (Task ID: 7)
	-	[1] Expose all car variables to ImGUI debug widget interface
	-	[2] Find good defaults for vehicle settings

-	[3]	Async Resource Loader (Task ID: 8)
	-	[1] Implement async resource loading thread
	-	[1] Implement load logic for all game meshes
	-	[1] Debug and Integration

-	[3] Make Game menus (Task ID: 9)
	-	[1] Implement a UI main menu 
	-	[2] Implement navigation and selection logic for controller input

## WEEK 12: HUD IMPLEMENTATION AND NEW RACETRACK

### Plan Proposed:

-	[3]	Create Vehicle HUD  (Task ID: 10)
	-	[1] Create a speedometer widget to use car momentum
	-	[1] Display lap information and best times
	-	[1] Render HUD with both UI widgets

-	[3] Test and Refine HUD  (Task ID: 11)
	-	[1] Adjust widget placement
	-	[1] Debug speedometer using debug values on screen
	-	[1] Debug lap system display for all 4P recorded times

-	[3]	Model New Race Track (Task ID: 12)
	-	[1]	Scale all mod kit pieces to be larger
	-	[2]	Implement new tack design

-	[3] Model Race Track Collisions and meta-data (Task ID: 13)
	-	[2] Model collision meshes to be used for PhysX
	-	[1] Setup .mesh file to load all the collision mesh information
