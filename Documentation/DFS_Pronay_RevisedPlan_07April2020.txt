# DFS-2 Project plan revision (04/07/2020)

Name : Pronay
Cohort: C28
Project: TAR (Time Attack Racer)

Notes about this document:

- Each task has been assigned estimated time, task desciption and a NewTask ID. Format followed is below:
	[TimeEstimate] <Task Desciption> (NewTask ID: ##)
- Under each week's "Proposed plan" is an "Hours worked" section to be updated with actual time spent on task and the date for when it was done.
- Each week has it's total hours planned listed along with space to list the total hours worked. 

## WEEK 11: DEBUG FEATURES AND CAR TOOL (This Week)

### Plan Proposed:

	-	[3]	Debug Features (NewTask ID: 1)
		-	[1]	Display FPS and frame times on screen
		-	[1.5] Display debug values for gear, speed, brake, handbrake and other car controller variables
		-	[0.5] Hook events to DevConsole for checkpoint crossing, race completion, best time for all players and gear switch on car

	-	[2]	Implement a car reset hotkey (NewTask ID: 2)
		-	[1] Implement a hotkey to "translate car along world up then set to default orientation"
		-	[1]	Test and debug (This involves quaternion math so I want to be extra sure)

	-	[3] Implement Car Tool (NewTask ID: 3)
		-	[2] Expose all car variables to ImGUI debug widget interface
		-	[1] Setup data and interface required to send vehicle info to PhysXSystem

### Hours Worked:

	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Debug Features (NewTask ID: 1)
	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Implement a car reset hotkey (NewTask ID: 2)

## WEEK 12: GAME LOOP COMPLETION AND CAR TUNING

### Plan Proposed:

	-	[3]	Create a tune system(NewTask ID: 4)

		-	[1] Implement some statefull-ness (LOADING_STATE, MENU_STATE, GAME_STATE, END_STATE)
		-	[1] Create a duplicate menu for end of race to have "REPLAY", "RETURN TO MENU" functionality

	-	[4] Implement a car HUD  (NewTask ID: 6)
		-	[2] Implement a radial speedometer
		-	[1] Implement a lap tracker using each player's waypoint system
		-	[1] Display current times for all players

	-	[3]	Tune the car(NewTask ID: 7)
		-	Find good values for the car

### Hours Worked:

	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Create a tune system(NewTask ID: 4)
	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Create a Simple Menu  (NewTask ID: 5)
	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Implement a car HUD  (NewTask ID: 6)

Total Hours Planned: 14 Hours
Total Hours Worked: X Hours

## WEEK 13: TRACK REFINEMENT AND PLAYER CONVEYANCE

### Plan Proposed:

	-	[3]	Add more meshes to scene(NewTask ID: 8)
		-	[2] Use XML to load meshes and their Transforms into the scene
		-	[1] Debug (Verify models are loaded correctly and in the right places)

	-	[6]	Fix track and car scale(NewTask ID: 9)
		-	[4]	Resize track to be bigger so lane is a good size for 2 cars
		-	[2]	Test with 2 cars and make refinements

	-	[3]	Conveyance for player(NewTask ID: 10)
		-	[1]	Make 4 car albedo variants for all 4 players and load different ones for each
		-	[2] Implement world-space UI text over car to indicate P1,P2,P3,P4 

### Hours Worked:

	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Add more meshes to scene(NewTask ID: 8)
	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Fix track and car scale(NewTask ID: 9)
	-	[ ] (04/00/2020) Conveyance for player(NewTask ID: 10)

Total Hours Planned: 12 Hours
Total Hours Worked: X Hours
